# Tenet
A starting point for designing and building the frontend of large web projects. 

## What is this?
Tenet is a sensible toolkit for starting large front-end projects, and for prototyping designs for the web. It is opinionated, and a detailed guide to the suggested methodology for working with this toolkit will follow.
Tenet aims to help reduce the introduction of technical debt, which is useful because you or another human like you will almost certainly end up maintaining that project.
Tenet has been in use in production in various forms since 2013, though in it's original incarnation it was tightly coupled to a CMS.

## Who is this for?
This is not a CSS library for engineers looking to get their MVP app styled quickly; there are already many excellent tools for that.
This is a set of tools and a methodology for front-end engineers who write hundreds (if not thousands) of lines of CSS on a daily basis, on large projects, and seek to avoid introducing technical debt.
Tenetis also a handy starting point for front-end designer-engineers who design in-browser.

## Requirements
You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

## Installation
In your terminal, `cd` into the root, then run `npm i` to install dependencies.
Run `gulp` to compile your styles and javascript, and watch for changes.
